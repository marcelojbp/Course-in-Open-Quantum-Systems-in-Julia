# Course-in-Open-Quantum-Systems-in-Julia
This repository keeps all the material used in a one week course in numerical simulations in Open Quantum Systems. We use the Julia language and largely the QuantumOptics package. The material includes theory notes, exercise sheets, examples and exercises. The numerics are done in Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb).
